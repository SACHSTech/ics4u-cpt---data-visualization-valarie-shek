# ICS4U - CPT: Data Interaction and Visualization

# Summary
### A description of the data set used:

The data set that I am using is a list of NBA players' stats in the season 2020. There are a total of 26 items per person, which means that there are a total of 26 columns. Since too much data would possibly affect the speed of a program, a randomized 104 items were used in this program, making the arrayList size to be 105 rows times 26 columns. These 26 columns include very commonly seen statistics such as name, age, team, position, games played, minutes playes, and such.

### Why this data set was selected for this project:

This data set was selected for this project because basketball is a popular sport and it has a long history. The data or statistics on their players are usually as detailed as it can be. On a personal level, basketball is definitely my favourite sport and I would also watch NBA games, thus, making the idea of using the statistics of NBA players even more interesting. That's why this data set was selected for this project.
