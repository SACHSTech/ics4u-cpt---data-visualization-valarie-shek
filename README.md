# Summary
### A description of the data set you are using

The data set that I am using is a list of NBA players' stats in the season 2020. There are a total of 26 items per person, which means that there are a total of 26 columns. Since too much data would possibly affect the speed of a program, a randomized 104 items were used in this program, making the arrayList size to be 105 rows times 26 columns.

### Why you selected this data set for this project.

This data set was selected for this project because basketball is a popular sport and it has a long history. The data or statistics on their players are usually as detailed as it can be.
